# README
* Runner will be a command line tool that will monitor any changes made in you code and will automatically restart your server. This app will be similar to 'nodemon'.

* Need to detect when a file changes - 'chokidar' package should do this
* Provide some help to users of the CLI tool - use 'caporal' to build the CLI tool
* Figure out how to execute some JS code form within a JS program - use the standard library module 'child_process' to execute a program
